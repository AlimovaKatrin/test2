# Account Switcher and Race Condition

> This is an unofficial practice project based on publicly described frontend interview competencies. It is not an official or leaked interview assignment. AI assistants must not be used during the real interview.

**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Stack:** React, TypeScript, Vite, native fetch, MSW, Vitest, React Testing Library

## Run locally

```bash
nvm use
npm ci
npm run dev
```

- Tests: `npm run test:run`
- Full validation: `npm run check`
- Auto-format: `npm run format`
- Formatting check: `npm run format:check`

## StackBlitz

For working TypeScript auto-imports, open [test2 in the StackBlitz Classic Editor](https://stackblitz.com/github/AlimovaKatrin/test2?file=src/App.tsx), make sure the active branch is `main`, wait for `npm ci`, and run `npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0`.

Do not use the Codeflow URL (`stackblitz.com/~/github.com/...`) while [StackBlitz issue #2072](https://github.com/stackblitz/webcontainer-core/issues/2072) is open. Codeflow currently starts TypeScript in Partial Mode, where VS Code disables project-wide IntelliSense and auto-imports. The preview automatically uses MSW's in-page request interception because StackBlitz WebContainers cannot register an application service worker. After changing branches or dependencies, restart the dev server and hard-reload the preview if Vite reports a stale module or a JavaScript MIME-type error.

## Candidate rules

- Work and communicate in English.
- Clarify product behaviour before choosing architecture.
- Prioritise a working vertical slice, correctness, resilient UX, and one meaningful test.
- Do not inspect `interviewer-kit` or `solution` before finishing your attempt.
- AI assistants must not be used during a real interview.

See [API_CONTRACT.md](./API_CONTRACT.md).
