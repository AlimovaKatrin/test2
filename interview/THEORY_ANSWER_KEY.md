# Theory Answer Key — Account Switcher and Race Condition

## Q01

**Category:** JavaScript  
**Difficulty:** medium

**Question:** Explain what happens after an await, including Promises, the Event Loop, microtasks, and tasks.

**Minimum acceptable:** await suspends the async function and its continuation runs in a microtask after settlement.

**Strong answer:** Distinguishes call stack, task queue, microtask checkpoint, promise reactions, and why long synchronous work still blocks rendering.

**Common incorrect answer:** await starts a new OS thread.

**Red flags:** Confidently treats compile-time types as runtime validation, ignores user-visible failures, or cannot connect the answer to the code.

**Neutral follow-up:** “How would that change the behaviour we can observe here?”

**Advanced follow-up:** “What trade-off would make a production solution different without adding interview-time complexity?”

**Connection to practical:** Reason about request completion and rendering order.

## Q02

**Category:** JavaScript  
**Difficulty:** medium

**Question:** How do arrays, objects, Map, and Set differ, and how do you update collections immutably?

**Minimum acceptable:** Choose by access/uniqueness needs and create new arrays or objects instead of mutating state.

**Strong answer:** Explains identity, insertion order, deduplication, lookup costs, spread/map/filter, and why sort/reverse/splice can mutate.

**Common incorrect answer:** React automatically observes every in-place mutation.

**Red flags:** Confidently treats compile-time types as runtime validation, ignores user-visible failures, or cannot connect the answer to the code.

**Neutral follow-up:** “How would that change the behaviour we can observe here?”

## Q03

**Category:** JavaScript  
**Difficulty:** medium

**Question:** What is a closure, and how can a stale closure affect an async React callback?

**Minimum acceptable:** A closure captures lexical bindings; a callback can observe values from an older render.

**Strong answer:** Explains render snapshots, functional updates, refs, dependencies, and cancellation/request IDs as distinct remedies.

**Common incorrect answer:** Closures always read the newest state.

**Red flags:** Confidently treats compile-time types as runtime validation, ignores user-visible failures, or cannot connect the answer to the code.

**Connection to practical:** Prevent old requests or timers from applying obsolete values.

## Q04

**Category:** TypeScript  
**Difficulty:** medium

**Question:** Why should external JSON begin as unknown? Compare narrowing, runtime validation, and an unsafe type assertion.

**Minimum acceptable:** TypeScript does not validate JSON at runtime; unknown forces checks.

**Strong answer:** Describes structural validation, type guards/schema libraries, error paths, and why as changes compiler belief only.

**Common incorrect answer:** as converts malformed data at runtime.

**Red flags:** Confidently treats compile-time types as runtime validation, ignores user-visible failures, or cannot connect the answer to the code.

## Q05

**Category:** TypeScript  
**Difficulty:** medium

**Question:** Compare a DTO and a domain model. Include discriminated unions, never, optional, and nullable fields.

**Minimum acceptable:** DTO matches transport JSON; the domain model matches UI needs; unions model valid states.

**Strong answer:** Explains boundary mapping, exhaustive never checks, absence versus explicit null, and preventing impossible states.

**Common incorrect answer:** DTO and domain types must always be identical.

## Q06

**Category:** React  
**Difficulty:** medium

**Question:** Describe trigger, render, reconciliation, and commit. What changes in Strict Mode?

**Minimum acceptable:** A state/prop update triggers render; React reconciles; commit mutates the DOM.

## Q08

**Category:** React  
**Difficulty:** medium

**Question:** How do keys affect identity, and when do composition or error boundaries matter?

**Minimum acceptable:** Stable keys preserve item identity; composition keeps responsibilities local; error boundaries catch rendering failures.
