# Production Improvements — Account Switcher and Race Condition

- Replace manual guards with a runtime schema library and structured validation telemetry.
- Use structured domain errors, correlation IDs, monitoring, and privacy-safe logs.
- Integrate the real authentication lifecycle without persisting secrets in frontend source.
- Complete keyboard, screen-reader, contrast, and internationalisation audits.
- Represent money in minor units or a decimal type and centralise locale/currency policy.
- Evaluate a server-state library for caching, invalidation, deduplication, cancellation, and retry policy.
- Define capped exponential backoff with jitter and explicit retryable status codes.
- Add analytics for failure/recovery funnels without collecting sensitive values.
- Add contract tests, broader integration tests, and focused E2E journeys.
- Add observability for latency, partial failure, stale results, and duplicate actions.

These are discussion points, not requirements to implement during the timed interview.
